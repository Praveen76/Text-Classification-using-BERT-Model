## Introduction

Text classification is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves assigning predefined categories or labels to text documents. In this project, we leverage the power of the BERT Model, a state-of-the-art transformer-based model, to perform text classification on the IMDB movie reviews dataset.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of the experiment, you will be able to:

- Load a BERT model from TensorFlow Hub
- Build your own model by combining BERT with a classifier
- Train your own model by fine-tuning BERT on the IMDB dataset
- Save your model and use it to perform sentiment analysis

## Usage

### Running the Notebook Locally

To run the notebook locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Praveen76/Text-Classification-using-BERT-Model.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

    ```
    cd Text-Classification-using-BERT-Model
    ```

3. Open the notebook file `Text_Classification_using_BERT_Model.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

4. Make sure you have all the required dependencies installed. You can install them using the following command:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. Execute the notebook cells one by one to load the BERT model, build your own model, fine-tune BERT on the IMDB dataset, and perform sentiment analysis.

### Running the Notebook on Google Colab

You can also run the notebook directly in your browser using Google Colab. Click the "Open in Colab" badge above, and it will open the notebook in Colab. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the cells and perform the analysis.
